## About this software

This software is a small library that implements the ability to cancel HTTP operations using a [Client](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html) from the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package.  
This is implemented using a composition of class [Client](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html) and class [CancellationToken](https://pub.dev/documentation/multitasking/latest/multitasking/CancellationToken-class.html).  
When a cancellation request is performed, the token cancels the HTTP operation.

The result of the cancellation is the exception [CancellationException](https://pub.dev/documentation/multitasking/latest/multitasking/CancellationException-class.html), which indicates that the operation did not complete successfully.

Canceling an HTTP operation on the client does not mean cancelling the operation on the server.  

Client-side cancellation allows to automatically cancel the following actions:

- Receiving data from the server on the client
- Sending data from the client on the server
- (If necessary) Any action on the client that can be interrupted by throwing an exception (using `token.throwIfCanceled()`)

Canceling an HTTP operation, do not close the client. If closing a client is mandatory (according to convention), then it must be explicitly closed using the `close()` method.  
The client prevents a request from being sent if a cancellation request has already been made previously.  

The operating algorithm is as follows.

**Receiving data from the server**.  
If a cancellation request is initiated before a response is received from the server, the response is ignored and the operation of receiving data from the server is cancelled immediately after receiving a response.  
If a cancellation request is initiated after a response is received from the server, the operation to receive data from the server is canceled immediately.  

**Sending multipart data to the server.**  
Before sending a request, the client prepares the data to be sent.  
Data transfer is performed through streams for each part independently.  
These streams must be submitted to the request as [cancelable](https://pub.dev/documentation/multitasking/latest/multitasking/StreamExtension/asCancelable.html) streams (that is, supporting the cancel operation and throwing the  `CancellationException` exception).  
Initiating a cancellation request cancels the sending of data through these streams.
